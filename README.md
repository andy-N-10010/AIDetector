## Plan for how the art detector will be built
The front-end will be with Swift because of the iPhone iOS camera and interface.
The backend will be with C++ or GoLang for computations and data management.
For training the AI to detect the suspicious photos, we will use Python.

## Requirements
Iphone camera 
Probably download the app or something
